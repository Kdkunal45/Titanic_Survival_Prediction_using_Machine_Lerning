# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the loss of a large number of lives. 

The main goal of this project is to analyze passenger data (such as age, sex, class, etc.) and create a predictive model that accurately determines whether a passenger survived or not. This predictive model can be valuable for understanding the factors that contributed to survival and for predicting survival probabilities for passengers in similar scenarios.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as their age, sex, class, ticket fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set contains the survival information for a subset of passengers, which will be used to train the machine learning models. The test set contains information for the remaining passengers, and the trained models will be used to predict whether these passengers survived or not.
